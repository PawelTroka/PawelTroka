As an impassioned software engineering lead & architect 🛠️, my journey is fueled by the sheer thrill of building innovative solutions. Specializing in C#, .NET, Python, scalable architectures, high-performance low-latency software solutions and Microsoft-related technologies 💻, I channel my love for good software engineering into every project I touch.

My scientific curiosities extend across a wide spectrum 🧪 – from numerical analysis and vibrational mechanics, through to physics and mathematics. This extensive knowledge allows me to craft complex, non-trivial software solutions 💡, demonstrated through my open-source contributions to the "Computator.NET" project.

Emphasizing the significance of clean code, design patterns, and meticulous unit testing, I believe that the journey is as essential as the destination 🛤️. Navigating legacy code and dated technologies, such as Windows Forms, comes naturally to me, as does my ability to debug and rectify issues. Yet, my pulse quickens when faced with the prospect of developing fresh, pioneering features.

In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, I keep my finger firmly on the pulse of the latest advancements 🚀. Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, .NET 8, PyPy, microservices, scalable architectures, React, and TypeScript – these are the building blocks that shape my work. My passion for "Microsoft 2.0" mirrors my belief in a future where open-source is embraced wholeheartedly 💙.

As a recognized expert in high-performance computing, my mastery of CUDA, parallel programming, and MPI places me at the forefront of the field 🏎️. Profiling and optimizing code to squeeze out every drop of efficiency is my game. As a regular speaker at tech conferences, like Infoshare, I enjoy sharing my insights with a global audience 🌎.

My background in the algorithmic and automated trading domain, coupled with my experience in energy markets and regenerative finance (ReFi) on-chain applications, equips me with a unique blend of knowledge and skills. My strong mathematical background serves as my guiding compass in these intricate landscapes 🧭.

Balancing my tech-driven pursuits, I am a fitness enthusiast 🏋️‍♂️, with bodybuilding as my sport of choice. My regular gym visits – a non-negotiable part of my routine – reflect my commitment to discipline and perseverance, hallmarks that I bring into every aspect of my life 💪.
